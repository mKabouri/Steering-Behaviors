# Steering-Behaviors

### Motivation:
The project is inspired by the desire to simulate and visualize various steering behaviors. These behaviors are fundamental in game development, robotics, and AI.

### Description:
This project implements several steering behaviors. It visualizes behaviors such as Seek, Flee, Flocking, and Circuit navigation. Each behavior is encapsulated in its own class with a clear interface, allowing for easy expansion and modification.

My goal is to implement a small library of steering behavior for simulations.

### Demonstration:
* Flocking behavior (see ./flock_behavior.gif):

![Flocking Behavior Simulation](./flock_behavior.gif)

* Circuit behavior (see ./circuit_behavior.gif):

![Circuit Behavior Simulation](./circuit_behavior.gif)


### Commands:
To run simulation:
```
python3 src/run.py
```
This will run the simulation with circuit behavior.

For other behaviors:
```
python3 src/run.py -b behavior_name 
```

where behavior_name is one of the following implemented behaviors:
* "seek" for SeekParticule,
* "flee" for FleeParticule,
* "circuit" for CircuitBehavior
* "flock" for FlockingBehavior
* "random" for RandomBehavior

After running, you can use your mouse:
- `LEFT CLICK`: Add a particule.
- `RIGHT CLICK`: Add a target (Seek and Flee behaviors) or an obstacle (Circuit behavior).
- `Q KEY`: Quit the simulation.
- `RESTART BUTTON`: Click to reset the environment.

### Improvements:
- Adding more behaviors (see Greg Reynolds paper).

### Done:
1. **Random**: The particule moves randomly in the environment.
2. **Seek**: Enables particules to autonomously move towards a target point.
3. **Flee**: Avoid the target.
4. **Multi-Particules (Flocking)**: Simulates flocking behavior among groups of particules. The particles are grouped based on particule color criteria.
5. **Circuit**: Particules navigate through a predefined circuit, avoiding collisions with other particules and obstacles and following the path.
